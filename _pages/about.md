Hello! I am Oscar Skean, a fourth-year PhD student at the University of Kentucky studying computer science and machine learning. I am broadly interested in the fields of representation learning, self-supervised learning, and information theory as well as the intersections of these fields. Most recently I been applying information-theoretic principles to understand representations and to enhance computational efficiency in self-supervised learning for computer vision.

During the summer of 2024, I am doing an internship at Stripe in San Francisco, CA. There I am working as a Machine Learning Engineer using self-supervised learning on very large datasets.

At the moment this site is pretty barebones, but I plan to write blog posts here going over the things I've worked on and the things I find interesting in the field.
